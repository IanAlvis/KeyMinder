Raspberry Pi Final Project Title: The Key-Minder

Team Name: The Forgetful Four

Project Team Members:
1.Ian
2.Krish
3.Carter

Project Summary:
Our project will be a smartphone app that allows you to update it at any time with a list of reminders 
and dates for things you want to get done. Then, it automatically uploads to the Key-minder. The 
Key-minder is a smart key holder that detects whenever the key is removed, and automatically responds 
by showing you a color and possibly a sound based on what you need to remember. Have a test tomorrow? 
Your Key-minder will light up red. Have homework due at the end of the week? Your Key-minder will light 
up yellow. Have to remember to call mom? Your Key-minder will light up green. You can set the priority 
/ color of each task, or a date where the Key-minder will show more intense colors the closer you are 
to it. The Key-Minder works off the premise of “jogging your memory”. By seeing the light whenever you 
grab your keys, it reminds you to check your to-do list.

Tasks:
Ian - Research into IR sensors and wireless communication, and designing circuits.
Krish - Begin looking into GUI and develop a rough interface
Carter - Began setting up Github Repository for the project and developing Keyminder code.

GPIO:
We plan to implement GPIO functionality by using an arduino inside the keyholder prototype to update 
off of the app, displaying colors based off of the tasks you have and the urgency of them. This will 
use an RGB LED, along with an infrared sensor to detect distance, detecting that the keys aren't on 
the keyholder and displaying the color as a result.

GUI:
We will use GUI on the project through the “smartphone app” that we will be using to demo the 
Key-Minder. The GUI will actually be on a laptop for the demo, as we do not have experience working 
with developing apps, and it will be difficult to get one onto a phone. The resolution of the GUI and 
its design will be compatible with an iphone, however. This GUI allows the storage and communication of 
tasks that will be sent to the Key-Minder remotely (For testing purposes, we may or may not be 
connecting them with a wire).

This is the change.g

Github:
We have currently set up a Github at https://github.com/IanAlvis/KeyMinder.git.
This is where we have been uploading the code for our Key-minder.
